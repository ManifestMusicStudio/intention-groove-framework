**Intention Groove™** is an open operational framework for designing audio architecture that optimizes human cognitive state. It acts as a bridge between archaic sound technologies (Heka, Galdr, Mantra) and modern neuroscience (Neuroplasticity, DMN Deactivation, Rhythmic Entrainment).

This repository contains the documentation for the methodology, mechanics, and logic behind the framework.

## 🧠 1. The Core Philosophy

The framework posits that music is not merely entertainment but a form of **programmable code** for the human operating system. By aligning semantic input (lyrics) with psychoacoustic drivers (rhythm/frequency), we can bypass the critical factor of the conscious mind and install new cognitive patterns.

### The Master Equation
The efficacy of an audio protocol is calculated as follows:

$$
\Delta S = \left( \frac{L_{pos} \times R_{ent}}{C_{res}} \right)^{T}
$$

Where:
*   $\Delta S$ = **State Shift** (Change in cognitive/physiological state).
*   $L_{pos}$ = **Lyrical Positivity Score** (Semantic valence > 0.8).
*   $R_{ent}$ = **Rhythmic Entrainment Factor** (BPM alignment with target heart rate).
*   $C_{res}$ = **Cognitive Resistance** (Reduced by "Direct Command Language").
*   $T$ = **Time/Repetition** (Duration of exposure).

## 🏛 2. The Kernel: 10 Universal Mechanics

The framework is built upon 10 fundamental mechanics ("The Decalogue") derived from comparative anthropology and validated by cognitive science.

| ID | Mechanic Name | Function | Ancient Root (Lineage) | Neuro-Mechanism (Science) | Protocol Mapping |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **M01** | **Onomaturgy** | Naming & Defining Reality | Egyptian *Heka*, Sumerian *Me* | **Self-Perception Theory:** Labeling influences identity. | `PROTOCOL 01: THE KEY` |
| **M02** | **Mantra** | Reprogramming | Vedic *Chhandas*, Sufi *Zikr* | **Neuroplasticity:** Repetition strengthens synaptic pathways. | `PROTOCOL 02: THE METER` |
| **M03** | **Origin** | Reframing Trauma | Finnish *Synnyt*, Navajo *Way* | **Memory Reconsolidation:** Altering neural association of memories. | `PROTOCOL 03: THE ORIGIN` |
| **M04** | **Unbinding** | Boundaries & Catharsis | Norse *Níð*, Irish *Glám dícenn* | **Cortisol Discharge:** Controlled aggression releases stress. | `PROTOCOL 04: THE BLADE` |
| **M05** | **Activation** | Symbol + Sound | Norse *Galdr*, Hermetic Sigils | **Dual Coding Theory:** Visual + Audio = 2x retention. | `PROTOCOL 05: THE SYMBOL` |
| **M06** | **Harmonization** | Regulation | Greek *Orphic*, Pythagorean | **Polyvagal Theory:** Vagus nerve stimulation via frequency. | `PROTOCOL 06: THE TRANCE` |
| **M07** | **Cataloging** | Resource Accumulation | Celtic *Amergin* | **Cognitive Priming:** Flooding associative networks. | `PROTOCOL 07: CATALOG` |
| **M08** | **Liminality** | Hypnagogic Access | Roman *Carmen* | **Theta Waves:** Increased suggestibility at sleep onset. | `PROTOCOL 08: THRESHOLD` |
| **M09** | **Binding** | Physical Anchoring | Hellenic *Katadesmos* | **Embodied Cognition:** Tactile feedback reinforces thought. | `PROTOCOL 09: VESSEL` |
| **M10** | **Embodiment** | Somatic Release | Dervish Whirling, *Haka* | **Somatic Processing:** Completing the stress cycle via movement. | `PROTOCOL 10: EMBODIMENT` |

## 🚀 3. Implementation: Genre Agnosticism

The Intention Groove™ framework is an **Operating System (OS)**. It can be installed into various musical "Shells" (Genres) depending on the user's context.

### 3.1. The High-Performance Shell
*   **Genres:** Phonk, Drift, Industrial Techno.
*   **Target State:** High Arousal, Focus, Aggression.
*   **Mechanic:** **M04 (Unbinding)** and **M07 (Cataloging)**.
*   **Use Case:** Gym, Sprints, Crisis Management.

### 3.2. The Flow Shell
*   **Genres:** Deep House, Lo-Fi, Electronica.
*   **Target State:** Alpha Waves, creative flow, "Zero Friction".
*   **Mechanic:** **M02 (Mantra)**.
*   **Use Case:** Coding, Deep Work, Design.

### 3.3. The Restoration Shell
*   **Genres:** Ambient, Drone, Neo-Classical.
*   **Target State:** Theta/Delta Waves, deep rest.
*   **Mechanic:** **M06 (Harmonization)**.
*   **Use Case:** Sleep, Meditation, Anxiety reduction.

### 3.4. The Generative Protocol (AI + Human)
This framework utilizes a **Hybrid Synthesis Model**:
*   **The Architect (Human):** Defines the Intention, Semantic Code (Lyrics), and Structural Blueprint.
*   **The Engine (AI):** Acts as the synthesizer to manifest the frequency using Large Audio Models (LAMs).
*   **The Calibration (Human):** Final tuning of resonance and arrangement for maximum efficacy.

## 🛡 4. Sonic Hygiene Standards

Any audio generated using this framework must adhere to the **Strict Hygiene Protocol** to ensure safety and efficacy.

1.  **No Negations:** The subconscious mind ignores "not". (e.g., *"I am not poor"* is forbidden; *"I am wealthy"* is accepted).
2.  **Direct Command Language (DCL):** Use present tense, active voice imperatives.
3.  **Zero Toxicity:** Exclusion of semantic markers associated with victimhood, heartbreak, or lack (unless used specifically for cathartic release in M04).
4.  **Bio-Sync:** BPM must align with the target heart rate of the desired state.

## 🔗 5. Semantic Data & Interoperability

For machine-readable definitions of this framework (compatible with Schema.org), please refer to [`manifest.jsonld`](./manifest.jsonld) in this repository. This allows AI agents and search engines to correctly interpret the relationships between the Mechanics and their physiological effects.
